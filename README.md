# Note - Paper Writing
The paper writing is in progress to be submitted to `Ocean Engineering`. 

## 7/20/2021
- `Latex` template for the `Ocean Engineering` has been downloaded. The final formatting is going to be processed by the online submission system, so the compiled document doesn't appear as a `Ocean Engineering` article format.

## Plan
- Type the basic information such as title, author, etc.
- Reformulate the narrative of the original thesis and reorganize the sections.
